## 📝 Project Title: **Flask MySQL To-Do List Application**

---

### 📌 Description:

This is a **full-stack To-Do List web application** built using **Flask (Python)** for the backend and **MySQL** as the database. The frontend is styled with **Bootstrap 5** 
for a clean, responsive, and modern user interface. It allows users to **add**, **view**, **update**, and **delete** tasks easily.

This project helped me understand the **complete flow of full-stack development**—how the frontend communicates with the backend and how the backend interacts with the 
database.

* ✏️ Edit/update existing tasks

### 🚀 How It Works:

1. Users access the home page to see all current tasks.
2. They can submit a new task using the form, which sends a POST request to the Flask server.
3. Tasks are stored in a MySQL database via SQLAlchemy.
4. Users can delete or edit any task, and changes reflect immediately.
5. Everything is presented in a user-friendly UI with animations and mobile responsiveness.
